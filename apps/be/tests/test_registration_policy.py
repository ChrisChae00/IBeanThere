"""
What registration turns away, now that a franchise is not on that list.

The line is no longer "how many outlets does this brand have" but "is this a cafe
that serves coffee" -- a franchise location can name its roaster and grind for
filter, and the shop with one address can pour from a bag nobody can name. So the
brand verdict is still recorded, and no longer decides.

The two claims:

1. A franchise name registers. It is classified, stored, and let through.
2. A bubble tea shop still does not.

No database and no map service: both are faked. The registration reaches the
duplicate check and lands on the existing-cafe branch, which is enough -- the
franchise verdict is read before that point, so arriving there at all is the
proof that it no longer rejects.
