/*
  The four-week question, and the smallest instrument that answers it.

  `docs/product/direction.md` asks three things about the people who had a chance to
  come back: did the app pick where they went, did they return on their own, did they
  look at what they wrote. That is three events and a pageview -- plus one for whether
  the coffee guide sends anyone to the map -- not a funnel builder,
  not session replay, not autocapture. Autocapture in particular would record every
  click on a page whose whole content is other people's coffee logs, which is more of
  other people's writing than a usage question needs.

  **Nothing is stored on the reader's device.** `persistence: 'memory'` means no cookie
  and no localStorage entry, so there is no consent banner to show and nothing to clear.
  The cost is stated in the direction doc and is not a bug: an anonymous visitor is a
  new person on every visit, so *return* is only measurable for someone signed in, whose
  id we already know. Every number about coming back is therefore a number about
  logged-in people, and reading it as "our visitors" would overstate it.

  Without `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` every function here does nothing. A developer with
  no key -- and a self-hosted copy -- runs the app with analytics simply absent, rather
  than with a client throwing on each call or, worse, quietly sending somewhere else.

  **`posthog-js` is imported at runtime, not built in.** Imported normally it lands in
  the layout's chunk, which is 285KB of parsed JavaScript on every page in the app --
  more than everything else the layout loads put together, to answer three questions.
  So the module is fetched after mount and only when a key exists, and the calls that
  arrive before it lands wait in a queue.

  The whole vocabulary. Adding a fourth is a product decision, not a convenience, so it
  costs an edit here -- an event nobody agreed to collect is the one that turns up in a
  dashboard six months later with nobody able to say what it counts.

  - cafe_detail_opened: a cafe page was read.
  - cafe_action_taken:  a door out to the real world -- directions, or the map link.
  - coffee_log_saved:   a cup was written down. `mode` separates drinking from buying.
  - learn_cta_clicked:  a reader of the coffee guide took its one prompt to the map.
                        `cta` says which prompt (`cafe` or `beans`), `page` whether it
                        was the guide itself or a drink page. Which drink is left out,
                        for the same reason its slug is masked in the path.

  The three cafe events carry `cafe_id`, and it is the uuid, never the slug: the same
  cafe is reachable under both, and two names for one place is how "opened it, then took
  the directions" stops being visible as one sequence.

  person until they cross the distinct-id limit -- at which point their events stop
  showing up at all. Bootstrapping the account id instead means a signed-in reader is
  the same person on every visit with nothing stored on their device, which is exactly
  what we wanted from this configuration.

  The part of this worth a check: which URL an event is allowed to report.

  PostHog reads `$current_url`, `$pathname` and `$referrer` off `location` for *every*
  event, so it is not enough to be careful in `capturePageview` -- the raw URL rides
  along on `cafe_detail_opened` too. Hence a sanitiser at the client, applied once to
  everything, rather than a rule each caller has to remember.

  Two things it fixes. Every path in this app starts with a locale, and the ids in it
  are a cafe uuid or slug, a username, or a share token. Left alone, `/en/cafes/x` and
  `/ko/cafes/x` are two pages and every cafe is its own page, so "how many cafe pages
  were opened" would mean counting a few hundred distinct URLs and no total. And a
  username or a share token in a URL is not ours to hand to an analytics vendor. The
  identity of the *cafe* still travels, as a property of `cafe_detail_opened`, where it
  can be counted or ignored on purpose.

  Query strings go entirely. They are how the rest of the app passes a `returnUrl`, and
  that carries the very path being masked here.
